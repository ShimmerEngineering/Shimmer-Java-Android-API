/**
 * DEV-896: A bounded (ring-buffer backed) trace optimised for the live time-series
 * streaming case where the X value is monotonically (non-decreasing) increasing.
 *
 * <p>Problem being solved: {@code Trace2DLtd.addPointInternal()} maintains the trace
 * min/max by, on every eviction of the oldest ring-buffer element, checking whether the
 * evicted point held an extreme and if so running a full linear rescan
 * ({@code ATrace2D.minXSearch()} / {@code maxXSearch()} / {@code minYSearch()} /
 * {@code maxYSearch()}) over the whole buffer. For a time-series plot X is strictly
 * increasing, so the evicted (oldest) point ALWAYS holds the minimum X, which triggers an
 * O(buffer) {@code minXSearch()} on essentially every sample in steady state. Because
 * {@code ATrace2D.addPoint()} does that work while holding {@code synchronized(chart)}
 * (the same monitor {@code Chart2D.paintComponent()} uses), the data thread starves the
 * Swing EDT and the plot stutters.</p>
 *
 * <p>Fix: when the ring buffer is known to be sorted ascending by X, the minimum X is
 * simply the oldest buffer element and the maximum X the youngest, both O(1). We override
 * {@code minXSearch()} / {@code maxXSearch()} to use those accessors on the fast path and
 * fall back to the (correct) superclass scan otherwise.</p>
 *
 * <p>Correctness / robustness:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>We only take the O(1) path when the buffer is guaranteed sorted ascending by X.
 *       That guarantee holds iff the most recent {@code size()} insertions all had
 *       non-decreasing X, because a ring buffer holds exactly the most recent
 *       {@code size()} insertions. We track the length of the current run of consecutive
 *       non-decreasing-X insertions ({@link #mAscendingRunLength}); when it is at least the
 *       current buffer element count the whole buffer content is that non-decreasing suffix,
 *       hence sorted.</li>
 *   <li>If X ever arrives out of order (e.g. plot re-fed on rewind / replay / device reset)
 *       the run is reset and we fall back to the superclass scans until enough monotonic
 *       samples have refilled the buffer, so the displayed range is always exact.</li>
 *   <li>Y is left entirely to the superclass, so the Y bounds are exactly the stock ones and no
 *       Y work is saved here. For random-walk Y the oldest point holds the Y extreme only
 *       ~2/size of the time, so that rescan is already amortised O(1). A monotone or steadily
 *       drifting Y channel (battery, temperature, GSR baseline, sample counters) is the bad case
 *       and still pays the superclass O(buffer) {@code minYSearch()}/{@code maxYSearch()} on
 *       essentially every sample; only the X half of the problem is fixed here. That is why the
 *       caller also bounds how many traces one chart-monitor acquisition covers.</li>
 *   <li>{@code setMaxSize(int)} is {@code final} in {@code Trace2DLtd} so it cannot be
 *       overridden, but no reset hook is needed: {@link #isBufferSortedAscendingByX()} reads
 *       the live {@code m_buffer.size()} each call. Growing leaves the element count and
 *       ordering unchanged (a sorted buffer stays sorted, so the fast path validly stays
 *       available); shrinking only discards the oldest, smallest-X elements, which also
 *       keeps the buffer sorted.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Externally this class reports the same bounds, property-change events and
 * {@code setMaxSize} semantics as {@code Trace2DLtd}; it only removes the redundant O(n) X
 * rescans. The one behavioural difference is a deliberate opt-out rather than a divergence: if any
 * error bar policy is installed on the trace, both X searches delegate wholly to the superclass,
 * because stock {@code minXSearch()}/{@code maxXSearch()} finish by folding the error bar extents
 * into the bounds and the O(1) path has no equivalent. It extends {@code Trace2DLtd} so existing
 * {@code ((Trace2DLtd)trace).setMaxSize(...)} / {@code .iterator()} casts keep working.</p>
